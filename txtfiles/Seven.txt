Weight of the world on your shoulders
I'll kiss your waist and ease your mind
I must be favored to know ya
I take my hands and trace your lines
It's the way that we can ride
It's the way that we can ride (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Think I met you in another life
So break me off another time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You wrap around me and you give me life
And that's why night after night
I'll be lovin' you right
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday (a week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Seven days a week
Every hour, every minute, every second
You know night after night
I'll be lovin' you right, seven days a week
You love when I jump right in
All of me, I'm offerin'
Show you what devotion is
Deeper than the ocean is
Wind it back, I'll take it slow
Leave you with that afterglow
Show you what devotion is
Deeper than the ocean is
It's the way that we can ride
It's the way that we can ride (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Think I met you in another life
So break me off another time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You wrap around me and you give me life
And that's why night after night
I'll be lovin' you right, oh-oh-oh
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday

Tightly take control, tightly take his soul
Take your phone and put it in the camera roll
Leave them clothes at the door
Watchu waitin' for? Better come and hit yo' goals
Uh, he jump in it, both feet
Goin' 'til the sun up, we ain't gettin' no sleep
Seven days a week, seven different sheets
Seven different angles, I could be your fantasy
Open up, say, "Ah"
Come here, baby, let me swallow yo' pride
What you on? I can match your vibe
Hit me up and I'ma Cha Cha Slide
You make Mondays feel like weekends
I make him never think 'bout cheatin' (uh)
Got you skippin' work and meetings
